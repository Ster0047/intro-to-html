         <p>A little bit about myself is that I hate talking about myself and love to go for walks at any time. I recently found graphic design as a course option and have felt like this is my passion. When I'm not a student, I'm a teacher teaching people how to paint, printmake or sculpt with clay. </p>

        <p>In my free time, you can almost always find me reading, roller skating, playing video games and watching a film with my cat on my off days. 
        I also love exploring various art to see what I can learn and grow from. I tend to paint in my free time with the mindset that there is only growth in having fun. </p>
